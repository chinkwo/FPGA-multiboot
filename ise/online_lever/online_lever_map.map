WARNING:Pack:2768 - At least one timing constraint is impossible to meet because component switching limit violations have been detected for
   a constrained component. A timing constraint summary below shows the failing constraints (preceded with an Asterisk (*)). Please use the
   Timing Analyzer (GUI) or TRCE (command line) with the Mapped NCD and PCF files to evaluate the component switching limit violations in
   more detail. Evaluate the datasheet for alternative configurations for the component that could allow the frequencies requested in the
   constraint. Otherwise, the timing constraint covering this component might need to be modified to satisfy the component switching limits
   specified in the datasheet.
INFO:Timing:3284 - This timing report was generated using estimated delay 
   information.  For accurate numbers, please refer to the post Place and Route 
   timing report.
Asterisk (*) preceding a constraint indicates it was not met.
   This may be due to a setup or hold violation.

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
